## Contribute

Feel free to contribute! Follow these steps:

First time only:

+ fork the **wES** repo (`upstream`) to your GitHub account (`origin`).
+ clone `origin` as your `local` repo

Every other time:

+ update both `origin` and `local` repos from `upstream`
+ create new branch for a feature or bug fix
+ commit often :)
+ once when work is done, push local changes to your `origin`
+ send us a pull request (PR)

We will pickup up from there :)
